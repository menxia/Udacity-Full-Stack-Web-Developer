# Movie Trailer Website

This project is about writting server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies. This is connected to the [Programming Foundations with Python](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud036) course.

## Directory Structure

* The file `fresh_tomatoes.py` contains the `open_movies_page()` function that will take in a list of movies and generate an HTML file.
* The file `media.py` contains a Movie class.
* In the file `entertainment_center.py`, I create a list of these movie objects and generate a HTML file.

## Quick Start

#### Command Line

> python entertainment_center.py
